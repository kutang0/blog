Hi, I'm Theo, I am currently developing software for surgical robots. Although my career path has been somewhat complex, drawn into the field of robotics in unexpected ways, I now enjoy understanding and working with abstract concepts. I develop surgical robot platforms using C++, and at home, I spend time exploring mathematics. I also enjoy discussing math with various people on the YouTube channel, EnjoyMath. After work, I cherish happy moments with my beloved son, Theo, and my wife as well.

### Life Advice
Here are a few things I've learned over the years,
> An optimist is simply a pessimist with no job experience.

> All of your co-workers are fools. You must learn to pity and tolerate them.

> There are very few problems that can't be solved through a suitable application of high explosives.
