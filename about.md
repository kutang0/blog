Hi, I'm Taehyeong(태형), I am currently developing software for surgical robots. Although my career path has been somewhat complex, drawn into the field of robotics in unexpected ways, I now enjoy understanding and working with abstract concepts. I develop surgical robot platforms using C++, and at home, I spend time exploring mathematics. I also enjoy discussing math with various people on the YouTube channel, [EnjoyMath](https://www.youtube.com/@enjoyingmath9346). After work, I cherish happy moments with my beloved son, Theodore, and my wife as well.

### Advice to Understand Something Abstract
> You have to describe things on a blank page.

> You have to be proficient enough that (mathmatical) definitions come naturally without deliberate thinking.

> Concrete examples always have to be at hand when exploring an abstract concept.
